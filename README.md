Femfy is a web application designed to manage women gynecological health and encourage early detection of diseases. This platform offers a wide range of services and features designed to accompany users in caring for their reproductive and general female health.

according to the type of user and family history, the possibility of adding a person so that they can be aware of the cycle and receive reminders through WhatsApp (Family, partner, etc.), the management of medical studies and the possibility of sharing them with professionals through a QR, 
a forum so that users can share their experiences with others and a virtual assistant for specific queries. 

This comprehensive approach seeks to provide women with the tools necessary to make informed decisions and maintain optimal well-being in all aspects of their gynecological health.
